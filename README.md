Learning Management System (LMS)
Short Description
This project is a full-stack Learning Management System (LMS) designed to facilitate online education. It allows users to register, log in, manage courses, edit profiles, and access educational content. The application is built using the MERN stack, providing a robust and scalable solution for e-learning platforms.
Tech Stack Used

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Libraries/Frameworks:
Axios (for API requests)
React Router (for client-side routing)
Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication
Bcrypt.js (for password hashing)


Other Tools:
Vite (frontend build tool)
MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
Postman (for API testing)



Features

User authentication (register, login, logout)
Course creation, editing, and deletion
User profile management
Course enrollment and progress tracking
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
Secure API with JWT-based authentication
Role-based access (admin, instructor, student)

How to Run Locally
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:
Prerequisites

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas account)
Git
npm or yarn

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/lms-project.git
cd lms-project


Install dependencies:

For the backend:cd server
npm install


For the frontend:cd client
npm install




Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the server/ directory with the following:MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000


Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your MongoDB Atlas URI or local MongoDB URI.
Replace your_jwt_secret_key with a secure random string.


Run the backend:
cd server
npm start

The server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Run the frontend:
cd client
npm run dev

The frontend will run on http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified by Vite).

Access the application:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.



API Endpoints
The backend provides the following API endpoints (base URL: http://localhost:5000/api):

Authentication:

POST /auth/register - Register a new user
POST /auth/login - Log in a user
GET /auth/me - Get authenticated user details (requires JWT)


Courses:

GET /courses - Get all courses
POST /courses - Create a new course (admin/instructor only)
PUT /courses/:id - Update a course (admin/instructor only)
DELETE /courses/:id - Delete a course (admin/instructor only)


User Profile:

GET /users/profile - Get user profile
PUT /users/profile - Update user profile



Note: All endpoints requiring authentication expect a JWT in the Authorization header as Bearer <token>.
Usage Examples

Register a new user:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"securepassword","role":"student"}'


Log in:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"securepassword"}'


Fetch all courses:
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/courses \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>"
